# HACK-PROJECT
NoHaze App
This is a skeleton for the No Haze app. For lack of time, the app is using placeholder data, when finished, it will use data for SMEAR API and SENTINELHUB API.
Main features:
-Provide user-friendly data of certain pollutants, such as SO2, cO2, NOx, which may cause the arctic haze phenomenol.
Data comes from 2 sources: smear(ground observation) and sentinelhub(satellite) to increase validity.
-User submission feature to increase data, and validate our measument on arctic haze.
-Warning notification if users are in dangerous areas with a high concentration of pollutants and low visibility.
